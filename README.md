# Creating anime characters using DCGANs and Keras

GANs could generate new data following the statistic features of the data in the training set. GANs is widely used to generate new and realistic photograph that is authentic to human observers.

Convolutional networks (CNNs) has seen huge adoption in computer vision applications. Applying the CNNs to GANs models could help us in building a photo generating model. The combined method is called Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Networks (DCGANs).

## Learning Objectives

- **Understand** the original formulation of GANs, and their two separately trained networks: Generator and Discriminator
- **Implement** GANs on simulated and real datasets
- **Apply** DCGANs to a dataset
- **Understand** how to train DCGANs
- **Generate** an image using a DCGAN
- **Understand** how changing the input of the latent space of DCGANs changes the generated image


## Lessons Learned

Focus on simulated data to better understand GANs. Further, we will use the case of massive anime avatar production to introduce how to use DCGANs.\
